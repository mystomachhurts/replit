Question 2 (Answer in a comment):
What are the two possible values of a bit?
How many bits are in a byte?
|#
       ; 0/1    ,
       ;8 bits
#|
Question 3 (Answer in a comment):
What word describes data that can be changed after it is created?
What word describes data that CAN'T be changed after it is created?

Question 4 (Anser in a comment)
What is a boolean, and what values can it be?
|#
;A binary variable that can output True or False 
#|
Question 5:
Define the following data:
- Create a variable called FIRST-NAME that stores your first name
- Create a variable called LAST-NAME that stores your last name
- Create a variable called AGE that stores your age
|#
(define FIRST-NAME "Abdul")
(define LAST-NAME "Tahlil")

(define AGE "18")
#|
Question 6:
Using the string concatenation operator (string-append), write a line of code
that produces the following text and stores it as a variable called INTRODUCTION:
"My name is *YOUR FIRST NAME* *YOUR LAST NAME*, and I am *YOUR AGE* years old."
You should NOT write your name or age in this line of code -
instead, reference the data you created in question 2.

|#
(define INTRODUCTION (string-append  " My name is " FIRST-NAME  LAST-NAME ", and I am " AGE " years old " ))
#|
Question 7:
Write a line of code that produces the length of INTRODUCTION
|#
(string-length INTRODUCTION)
#|
Question 8:
Complete the following math operations in code:
- Multiply your age by 10, then store the data as a variable called N1
- Subtract 20 from N1 and divide it by 5, then store the data as a variable called N2
- Add 4 to N2 and divide it by 2, then store the data as a a variable called N3
What is the value of N3?
|#
(define N1 (* 18 10))
(define N2 (/ (- N1 20) 5))
(define N3 (/ (+ N2 4) 2))
